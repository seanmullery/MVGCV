    "It refers to the bundle of rays that emit from a 3D point and hit each of our image frames.\n",

    "If our points are noisy, won't we line up with the wrong points?\n",
    "The answer is both yes and no.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firstly, yes, there will be no $(R,T,X)$ that can possibly get the rays to all line up unless there is no noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly, no, because noise should cause our image points to be out by different amounts in all directions randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we can find the bundle adjustment that gives the least error, then we are likely to have hit the centre of all of the noise.\n",

    "### Terms and Conditions\n",
    "So this idea that the true value is at the center of the noise is based on an idea called the central limit theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It firstly assumes the distribution of the noise is Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a bad assumption, this is the best model for noise. \n",

    "Bias is normally associated with calibration.\n",
    "An incorrect calibration can send all of your errors in one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, it assumes we have an infinite number of measurements.\n",
