    "\n",
    "So this has moved the vector from the world frame to the camera frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect what we are doing is moving the 3D origin from the world to the pinhole of the camera and all the vectors must move relative to that. \n",
    "The rotation is because the axis of the origin at the camera may be different from the world frame because the camera is rotated in some way.\n",
