    "The rotation is because the axis of the origin at the camera may be different from the world frame because the camera is rotated in some way.\n",

    "Radial distortion is distortion that has an effect that is related to the distance from the center of the lens. \n",

    "\n",

    "The basic problem is that the rules of projective geometry are broken i.e. straightness of lines are not preserved. \n",

    "The examples below show a (synthetic) radial distortion in order to drive home the point. \n",

    "What we notice is that the straight lines in the real world are curved in the image and this curving becomes more pronounced the further we get from the center.\n",
