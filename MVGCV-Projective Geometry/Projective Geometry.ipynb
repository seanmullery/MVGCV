    "To begin with, we normally always refer the algebra back to some picture or figure as if to prove that it is not just some sort of mathematical magic. \n",
    "\n",
    "But by using algebra we can free ourselves of the drawings (which, try as we might, can never really be exact) and move purely to abstract algebra to find solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In much the same way that imaginary numbers allowed us to find solutions to problems that could not appear on a graph, Analytic Geometry allows us to use all the systems of Algebra to produce a final result that, should we need to, we can always show pictorially.\n",

    "This may sound very limiting but ensuring that the straight lines in a figure are preserved under a transformation allows an enormous amount to be determined. \n",

    "## Homogeneous Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "We have mentioned these in a previous lecture and said we would come back to them. \n",
    "Homogeneous coordinates solve a number of problems.\n",
    "Firstly they encode our new ideas (agreements) about incorporating ideal points (points at infinity). \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly they can make an affine problem into a linear problem, which greatly eases our use of linear algebra.\n",
    "This is how you saw them being used earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2D Homogeneous are the easiest to intuitively understand but the 3D version is a direct extension. So if you can picture the 2D case you can accept the 3D case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So take the points on a 2D (x,y) plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now add a third dimension z. But this does not act like the ordinary z-axis.\n",
    "Move the entire x-y plane out to position 1 on the z-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that the origin (x=0,y=0,z=0) is the center of a projection. Turn every point in (x,y) into a line that passes through the origin and the point (x,y). \n",
    "Now imagine that you put another (x,y) plane at position 2 on the z-axis.\n",
    "       \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: If a line passes through the origin (x=0,y=0,z=0) and through a point (x,y,z=1) where will that line intersect the x-y plane at z=2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer (2x,2y,2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the case for any homogeneous coordinate, (kx,ky,k).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we meant by the z-dimension not being independent of the others.\n",
    "To get back to the standard coordinates you divide across by k.\n",
    "       \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what about points at infinity? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the standard x-y plane you would have to describe these as $(\\infty, \\infty)$ and there is no way to tell any ideal points apart. \n",
    "\n",
    "In homogeneous coordinates you do this as follows. You set the value of k to zero.\n",
    "e.g. If the ideal point is given as (3,2,0), this tells us we have a point at infinity in the direction (3,2). What are it's standard coordinates? Divide across by k=0.\\\\ $(\\frac{3}{0}, \\frac{2}{0}) = (\\infty, \\infty)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "So in homogeneous coordinates we can treat them as ordinary points that have a z vaule of 0. But in standard coordinates we would have to deal with them as exceptional cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do homogeneous coordinates make an affine problem linear? \n",
    "Well we turn every point in the affine space into a line that passes through the origin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lines that pass through the origin are linear. \n",
    "       "
