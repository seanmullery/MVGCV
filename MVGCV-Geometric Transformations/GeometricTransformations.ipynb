    "## Other rotation issues\n",
    "There are other issues too. \n",
    "Moving through the parameter space $(\\alpha,\\beta, \\gamma)$ is not always smooth. \n",
    "There are strict mathematical definitions for smoothness but in practice what this means is that small changes in overall movement do not always lead to small changes in each of the separate parameters. Sometimes a small change will require a very large change in one of the Euler angles. \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Euler Angles\n",
    "This is not to suggest that Euler angles are of no use. \n",
    "In particular where simple known rotations are required, perhaps between two fixed camera positions then simple rotations can be employed between the two views.\n",
    "However in the general case we would like a better method.\n",
    "Without getting too deep into the mathematics of vector spaces, the space of rotation matrices is not linear under addition. \n",
    "A common solution to this is to change to another space, which is linear, move about in that space and then move back.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smooth Path\n",
    "We would also like to determine a smooth path between two views rather than just determining the full rotations that will lead from one to the other. \n",
    "For example, the path that a camera took to get from one position/orientation to another is particularly useful when the views all come from one camera, which only takes an image at some sample period, and we may wish to interpolate between these.\n",
