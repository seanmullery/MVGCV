    "However in the general case we would like a better method.\n",
    "Without getting too deep into the mathematics of vector spaces, the space of rotation matrices is not linear under addition. \n",

    "We would also like to determine a smooth path between two views rather than just determining the full rotations that will lead from one to the other. \n",
